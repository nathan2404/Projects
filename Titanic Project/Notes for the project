One of the first datasets that any analyst in the Big Data sphere gets introduced to is the Titanic 
dataset. It also regularly features in computational prediction competitions as seen on 
https://www.kaggle.com/. The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in 
history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage from the UK to US, the Titanic sank after 
colliding with an iceberg. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, 
some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the 
upper-class.  

Using any analytical tool of your choice (e.g. R or Excel): 

4.1 Load “titanic.csv”. We want to see the deaths of passengers as per class in order to see 
whether preference was given to different classes. One of the best ways to visualize this is 
by simply plotting the data. Construct a plot to display deaths and survival per class - Pclass. 

4.2 Next, aggregate the data to see the gender split that was on the boat. What interesting 
feature do you notice when getting the gender split by class? 
Now that you have a better idea of the data structure, lets get more familiar with the statistical 
properties of it. One of the columns contain the age of the passengers. Using any plotting library 
familiar to you, please plot: 

4.3 The histogram of the age per passenger class. 

4.4 The histogram with its appropriate density over histogram. 

4.5 The age distribution of men in 3rd class. Why do you think this positively skewed distribution 
exists for this specific demographic segment? What story do you think this tells us about 
these men? 

4.6 Hearing of the tragedy, the first comment you hear when the discussion of the lifeboats 
come up is that women and children were first. Does this reflect in the data? Assume that a 
child is a passenger under the age of 15.
